## Development Approach

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `release/*`: Release branches

### Release Cycle

1. **Development**: Features are developed in feature branches
2. **Code Review**: Pull requests are reviewed and approved
3. **Integration**: Approved features are merged into develop
4. **Testing**: Develop branch is tested
5. **Release**: Develop is merged into main for release
6. **Deployment**: Main branch is deployed to production

### Quality Gates

- Linting must pass
- Tests must pass
- Code review must be approved
- Performance metrics must meet targets
- Accessibility requirements must be met

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API Rate Limiting | High | Medium | Implement caching and rate limiting |
| Performance Issues | High | Medium | Early performance testing and optimization |
| Browser Compatibility | Medium | Low | Cross-browser testing and polyfills |
| Scope Creep | High | High | Strict adherence to roadmap and change control |
| Technical Debt | Medium | Medium | Regular refactoring and code reviews |

### Contingency Plans

- **API Issues**: Implement fallback mechanisms and error handling
- **Performance**: Identify and optimize critical rendering paths
- **Browser Compatibility**: Establish minimum browser support targets
- **Scope Management**: Regular roadmap reviews and prioritization
- **Technical Debt**: Scheduled refactoring sprints

## Team Resources

### Roles & Responsibilities

- **Frontend Developer**: Implement UI components and features
- **Backend Developer**: Implement API integrations and data handling
- **Designer**: Create UI/UX designs and assets
- **QA Engineer**: Test features and identify issues
- **Project Manager**: Coordinate tasks and track progress

### Development Environment

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Package Manager**: npm/yarn/pnpm
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Hosting**: Netlify/Vercel

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using GitHub Projects with the following columns:

- **Backlog**: Tasks that are not yet scheduled
- **To Do**: Tasks scheduled for the current sprint
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
- **Review**: Tasks awaiting review
- **Done**: Completed tasks

Weekly status updates will be provided to track progress against the roadmap.

## Conclusion
