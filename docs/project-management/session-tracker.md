### Session 2 - February 26, 2025

**Duration**: 3 hours  
**Developer**: [Developer Name]

#### Goals for This Session

- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- Set up project folder structure
- Create layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)
- Implement API clients for data sources

#### What Was Accomplished

- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and ESLint
- Configured Tailwind CSS with a custom theme and dark mode support
- Set up the project folder structure according to documentation
- Created layout components:
  - Header with theme toggle functionality
  - Footer with links
  - Sidebar with source filtering
  - MainLayout to combine all layout components
- Implemented API clients:
  - Created a base API client for making HTTP requests
  - Implemented specific clients for Hacker News, DEV.to, and GitHub
  - Created a news service to aggregate data from all sources
  - Added data normalization for consistent display
- Implemented state management:
  - Created a ThemeProvider for light/dark mode
  - Implemented custom hooks for accessing news data
- Added search functionality
- Created a responsive home page with news feed

#### Decisions Made

- Used React Context for theme management instead of Zustand for simplicity
- Implemented custom API clients instead of SWR for better control over data normalization
- Used client-side rendering for the initial implementation to simplify development
- Created a modular folder structure to support future growth

#### Challenges Encountered

- ShadCN UI integration was challenging due to configuration issues
- Source toggling functionality in the sidebar needs improvement
- API rate limiting could be an issue with real-world usage

#### Next Steps

- Improve source toggling functionality
- Implement error handling and rate limiting for API requests
- Add loading states and error states
- Enhance the UI with animations
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling
- Create settings page for user preferences
