I'm continuing development on the HackerHome project, a tech news aggregator built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI. Please help me make progress on the current task.

## Context Loading Instructions

1. First, please review these key documentation files in order:
   - docs/README.md (for project overview)
   - docs/project-management/current-task.md (for active development focus)
   - docs/project-management/session-tracker.md (for previous session context)
   - docs/project-management/roadmap.md (for overall project progress)

2. Based on the current task, you may also need to review:
   - docs/architecture.md (for system architecture)
   - docs/frontend/* (for frontend implementation details)
   - docs/backend/* (for backend implementation details)
   - docs/design/design-system.md (for design guidelines)
   - docs/development/* (for development standards)

3. After reviewing the documentation, please:
   - Summarize the current state of the project
   - Identify the active task and its progress
   - Outline what needs to be accomplished in this session
   - Suggest a plan of action with specific steps

## Development Continuation

Now that you have context, let's continue development:

1. What is the next step we should take to make progress on the current task?
2. Are there any blockers or challenges we need to address first?
3. What files do we need to create or modify to implement the next feature?

Please provide specific, actionable guidance to help me make meaningful progress during this session.
