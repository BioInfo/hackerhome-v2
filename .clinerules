## Code Generation Excellence

### Requirement Handling
- **Standard Requirements**: Implement fully with best practices
- **Ambiguous Requirements**: 
  - Identify ambiguities explicitly
  - Make reasonable assumptions and explain them
  - Provide alternative implementations when appropriate
  - Ask clarifying questions when critical information is missing
- **Contradictory Requirements**:
  - Highlight contradictions respectfully
  - Suggest the most balanced approach
  - Explain tradeoffs between different approaches

### Test Case Generation
- Create unit tests for complex functions and components
- Include integration tests for critical user flows
- Generate test cases for edge conditions and error states
- Include example mock data for testing purposes
- Structure tests using arrange-act-assert pattern

### Documentation Best Practices
- Add JSDoc comments for exported functions, components, and types
- Include component prop documentation with examples
- Document state management patterns and data flow
- Provide usage examples for custom hooks
- Add meaningful comments for complex algorithms
- Use clear variable naming as self-documentation

### Response Detail Calibration
- For simple tasks: Provide concise solutions with minimal explanation
- For complex implementations: Include detailed reasoning and alternatives
- For educational responses: Explain thoroughly with conceptual background
- For debugging: Show detailed process of hypothesis and verification
- For optimization: Include performance considerations and benchmarks

## Development Process

### Initial Response Structure
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Explicitly restate and analyze requirements
   - Identify explicit and implicit needs
   - List constraints and assumptions
   - Flag potential edge cases

2. **Architecture Planning**: 
   - Begin with `<PLANNING>` tags
   - Outline component structure and data flow
   - Identify necessary libraries and tools
   - Create pseudocode for complex logic
   - End with `</PLANNING>` tags

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Explain your implementation approach
   - Choose patterns appropriate to the task
   - Address potential challenges proactively

### Code Implementation
4. **Staged Implementation**:
   - Build foundation first (data models, core components)
   - Add complex logic and user interactions
   - Implement error handling and edge cases
   - Add styles and responsive behavior last

5. **Code Review**: Use a self-review checklist:
   - Functionality: Does it meet all requirements?
   - Quality: Does it follow best practices?
   - Performance: Are there obvious optimizations?
   - Security: Are there potential vulnerabilities?
   - Accessibility: Does it follow a11y standards?
   - Edge cases: Are they properly handled?

6. **Finalization**:
   - Summarize what the code accomplishes
   - Highlight key implementation details
   - Suggest next steps or improvements

## Code Style and Structure

### File Organization
- Structure files with: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)
- Favor named exports for components

### Syntax and Formatting
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use early returns for better readability
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Event handlers should be named with "handle" prefix (`handleClick`, `handleKeyDown`)
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Use consts for function definitions (e.g., `const toggle = () =>`)
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax
- Use declarative JSX

### TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Define types for all variables and functions
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces

## UI Development and Styling

### Component Design
- Implement accessibility features on elements
  - Example: `<a>` tags should have `tabindex="0"`, `aria-label`, `onClick`, `onKeyDown`
- Use "class:" instead of ternary operators in class attributes when possible

### Styling Approach
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling; avoid CSS or style tags
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use Shadcn UI and Radix UI components when appropriate

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`
- Favor React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR
- Use `'use client'` only for Web API access in small components
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Implement dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Use code splitting effectively
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management

### Image Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component with proper configuration
- Recommend WebP format for optimal compression
- Include width and height to prevent layout shifts (CLS)
- Implement lazy loading with appropriate priority settings
- Set proper sizes attribute for responsive images

## State Management and Data Fetching
- Avoid using `'use client'` for data fetching or state management
- Use modern solutions (Zustand, TanStack React Query)
- Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing patterns
- Implement validation using Zod for schema validation

## Error Handling
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases
- Use early returns for error conditions
- Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
- Use custom error types for consistent error handling

## Code Quality Principles
- Write correct, bug-free, fully functional code
- Follow DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Focus on readability over performance when trade-offs are necessary
- Fully implement all requested functionality
- Leave NO todos, placeholders, or missing pieces
- Include all required imports
- Ensure proper naming of key components
- Be concise and minimize prose in code

## Interaction Guidelines

### Code Explanations
- Use markdown code blocks with proper language tagging
- Provide concise explanations of complex logic
- Add comments for non-obvious implementation details
- Only explain code when necessary; focus on delivering complete solutions

### Follow-up Support
- Be prepared to explain, debug, or refactor code based on feedback
- Answer technical questions related to the implemented solution
- Suggest testing strategies for the code
- Provide hints on how to extend or maintain the code

### Context-Awareness
- Respect existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Consider project-specific requirements and constraints
- Adapt to the user's skill level and communication style
- Reference relevant documentation when applicable

### Progressive Enhancement
- Begin with minimal viable solutions that cover core requirements
- Build on these foundations to add more advanced features
- Prioritize fundamental functionality before optimization
- Be explicit about which enhancements could be added later
